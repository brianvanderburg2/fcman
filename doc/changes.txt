0.20
----
* Between versions 0.8 and 0.20 were some Python command line releases for
  experimenting with some additional ideas, some of which will be added to
  the program.
* Added real mode support which allows moving and renaming contents in the
  collection to move and rename them in the real filesystem.

0.8
---
* Added ability for new/modified items to be marked dirty, so they can be later
  checked for any package and dependency changes and manually set to clean.

0.7
---
* Minor bug fix saving/loading file sizes, but only sizes up to ~4GB are supported

0.6
---
* Now maximize at startup
* Open a file from the command line
* No longer reload entire file when scanning for new or removing missing items
* Deleting a directory item selects previous item if possible else the parent item
* No prompt if no rename candidates
* Now moving and deleting multiple files is supported
* Track sizes of files and report if sizes are different during sanity check
* During checksum calculation, update file size as well
* During checksum calculation, if file sizes are different, they are considered
  new and so can be updated by doing a Calculate New Checksums
* Rename dialog show complete name of the new name as well
* Edit panel look changes
* Files can now have a description
* Calculate and verify checksum can be performed from the file list

  It checks basically everything except checksums
* Rename can now support multiple candidates

* Speed up calculating checksums a little by using a single memory buffer for
  all files instead of creating and destroying one for each file
